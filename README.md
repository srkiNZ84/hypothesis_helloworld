# Hypothesis HelloWorld example

## About

Simple example of using [Hypothesis|https://hypothesis.works] to test a python function.

The function takes a string and returns a string back having "multiplied" it by the number specified.

Wrote this to have a go at property-based testing and see how it works.

## How to run

Need to have as pre-requisites:

* Python
* pip install pytest
* pip install hypothesis

then just check out the code and run:

```
pytest -v
```
